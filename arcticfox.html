  <p> A small, round body with thick fur and a cute, fluffy tail help the Arctic fox survive its cold, harsh habitat. Even the bottom of its paws has hair to give the fox good traction as it races across icy ground. </p>

  <p> But for an Arctic fox, the tail, also called a "brush," is extra useful, since the fox curls it around the face like a scarf when the frigid winds blow. </p>

  <p>   An Arctic fox's fur changes colors with the seasons of the year. In winter, it is white so that it blends in with the snow. During the spring, the fox sheds its winter coat, revealing gray fur underneath. </p>

  <p>   Did you know? Arctic foxes have excellent hearing. When hearing the next meal scurrying under the snow, the fox leaps into the air and pounces, breaking through the layer of snow right onto the prey underneath. </p>
